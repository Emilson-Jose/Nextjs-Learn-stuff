Neither curriculums for Towson's general Computer Science track nor the Cyber Operations cybersecurity track had me delve specifically into Markdown as a choice text document format. Not to say Markdown never came up, but it was never a core requirement of any project or assignment.

Any of my understanding or familiarity of the format came from its use in GitHub README's and the Discord app.

# Initial impressions

While hardly made full use of .md in school, I always appreciated how clean it looked in the README sections of GitHub repositories.

- **Unordered** lists help draw attention to important features
- **Headings** mark important explanatory sections

In Discord, Markdown-supported messages allow me to jot down well-organized notes and give helpful formatting to longer, information-dense message

# The plan

The gameplan for learning this documentation style will be to make additions to the blog section of this site as was done in the tutorial.

While the tutorial's style is simple, I plan on evolving the style by looking at Markdown's documentation site by John Gruber.
