*tictactoe.py* is a command line executable version of the game Tic Tac Toe. It requires each player to send coordinates to the program to place their symbol. Once one player gets 3-in-a-row, they are asked if they want to go again or exit the program.

# Goal

This program was written to stretch my Python coding muscles. I focused on the following three aspects of coding for this refresher.

- Clarity - making the program easy to look at and understand. 
- 2D data management - applications of 2d array structures using Python lists
- User-control - Python input handling

# Reflection
