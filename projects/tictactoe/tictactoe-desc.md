*tictactoe.py* is a command line executable version of the game Tic Tac Toe. It requires each player to send coordinates to the program to place their symbol. Once one player gets 3-in-a-row, they are asked if they want to go again or exit the program.

# Goal

This program was written to stretch my Python coding muscles. I focused on the following three aspects of coding for this refresher.

- Clarity - making the program easy to look at and understand. 
- 2D data management - applications of 2d array structures using Python lists
- User-control - Python input handling

# Reflection

This project tested me on Python fundamentals such as input parsing and variable scope. Ensuring user inputs were effectively read, progressed the game, led to win states, and recieved clear error diagnosis when appropriate made up the majority of the project. The **tuple** data type researched and fit to the coordinate system I used for determining symbol placement.

- Python tuple is a data type storing an ordered set of 1 or more items. Items can be referenced by index and are immutable.

Importantly, I realized flaws in my scoping and planning methodologies through this project. I had planned to implement a move-reversal system (based on a past practice project coding tic-tac-toe) and a option to play with a simple CPU opponent. I'm confident I could add these functions, but the project as-is served the function of derusting my Python coding and creating a script for this personal site. My planning also had to evolve during this project as my methods for coding from two workstations evolved. Moving from using command line git to a combination of Github Desktop and Onedrive allowed for easier contributions from my laptop and desktop setups.
